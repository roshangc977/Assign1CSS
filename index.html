                    <h2>[Instrumental Intro]

                    [Verse 1]
                    There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
                    And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
                    When she gets there, she knows if the stores are all closed
                    With a word, she can get what she came for
                    Ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven

                    [Verse 2]
                    There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
                    'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
                    In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
                    Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

                    [Refrain]
                    Ooh, it makes me wonder
                    Ooh, makes me wonder

                    [Verse 3]
                    There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
                    And my spirit is crying for leaving
                    In my thoughts, I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
                    And the voices of those who stand looking

                    [Refrain]
                    Ooh, it makes me wonder
                    Ooh, really makes me wonder

                    [Verse 4]
                    And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
                    Then the piper will lead us to reason
                    And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
                    And the forests will echo with laughter

                    [Interlude]
                    Oh-oh-oh-oh-woah-ho

                    [Verse 5]
                    If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
                    It's just a spring clean for the May queen
                    Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
                    There's still time to change the road you're on

                    [Refrain]
                    And it makes me wonder
                    Ohh, oh-oh

                    [Verse 6]
                    Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
                    The piper's calling you to join him
                    Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
                    And did you know
                    Your stairway lies on the whispering wind? Oh


                    [Guitar Solo]

                    [Bridge]
                    And as we wind on down the road
                    Our shadows taller than our soul
                    There walks a lady we all know
                    Who shines white light and wants to show
                    How everything still turns to gold
                    And if you listen very hard
                    The tune will come to you at last
                    When all are one, and one is all, yeah
                    To be a rock and not to roll

                    [Outro]
                    And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
